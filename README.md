Hologram effect provides a sci-fi style to game. I modefied the shader graph to allow there is a texture option for objects, rather than basic colors.

In Pac-Man, this can be used on dots if we are using sci-fi theme or we can have a mechanic that create a hologram of pacman to distract enemies.

# Additional Shaders:

The rimlighting can be used to target the enemies or dots.

Also, we can have it on dots prividing more points ( seperating them from other ordinary dots ).

We can use this shader to modify what many kind of fluids, like lava, toxic-looking, by simply change the colors.

We can add some areas to have additional mechanics. For examples, we can have water areas and we have to look for boats, which were hidden, to get across;
toxic-looking, green areas as spawn points of enemies; dodge splashes from lavas, etc.
