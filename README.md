## 1. Holograms

Hologram effect provides a sci-fi style to game. I modefied the shader graph to allow there is a texture option for objects, rather than basic colors.

In Pac-Man, this can be used on dots if we are using sci-fi theme or we can have a mechanic that create a hologram of pacman to distract enemies.

## 2.Scrolling Texture

This can be used in outside view while we are on a train. Attatch them on different materials with different images and set them with different velocities.
For example, set sky image at the furthest and scroll slow, montain's closer and faster,etc.

The reason why I couldn't implement because I wanted to create with shader graph but I couldn't find a way to seperate UV's on X and Y axis.

# Additional Shaders:

## 1.RimLight

The rimlighting can be used to target the enemies or dots.

Also, we can have it on dots prividing more points ( seperating them from other ordinary dots ).

## 2.Modified Scrolling Fluid

We can use this shader to modify what many kind of fluids, like lava, toxic-looking, by simply change the colors.

We can add some areas to have additional mechanics. For examples, we can have water areas and we have to look for boats, which were hidden, to get across;
toxic-looking, green areas as spawn points of enemies; dodge splashes from lavas, etc.
